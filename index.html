            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>

            <h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
            <p>To put it simply, hackathons combine the two words: hacking and marathon. Participants will get the chance to form teams of up to 1-4 members, and bring a project idea to life! However, they only have 36 hours to accomplish this. Students will receive mentorship, learn about new job opportunities, and get some cool swag!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Who can Participate?</h3>
            <p>HackWin applications are open to post-secondary students from across the world. Whether you are a freshman or completing your PhD, we want you to apply! Unfortunately, we will not be accepting high school students at this time. Each application is reviewed from the HackWin organizing team, and decisions will be sent out on a rolling basis.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What if I've never been to a hackathon before</h3>
            <p>There's always a first time for everything, right? We highly encourage individuals with various levels of experience to apply to HackWin. HackWin is a hackathon where individuals from various disciplines, majors, and backgrounds are encouraged to come out and participate.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Can I start working on my hack before the event?</h3>
            <p>We follow the Major League Hacking guidelines, which prohibits students from bringing and continuing a project that they have already worked on. Your final project should be new and only built during the weekend of HackWin.</p>
